3. What are parts of the brain? Explain their functions. 

The parts of the brains are 

    i. The Cerebrum: It is the thinking part and controls voluntary movement, learning, intelligence and memory. It also helps us to understand the signals that we get from the sense organs. 
  
    ii. The Cerebellum: It is in charge of movement and helps to maintain the balance of the body. 
  
    iii. The Medulla: It controls the heartbeat, breathing, blood circulation, digestion and other involuntary actions like sneezing, swallowing and so on. 

4. Explain the difference between sensory and motor serves. 

Sensory Nerves: These nerves carry messages from the muscles and sense organs to the brain or spinal cord. The brain undestands what the organ has seen, heard, felt, smelt or tasted. 

Motor Nerves: These nerves carry messages from the brian or the spinal cord to the muscles. The brain instructs the muscles on how to act. For example, if your hands are cold, the brain sends a message that makes you put your hands in your pocket. 

5. Explain reflex action with an example. 

When we accidentally touch something hot, we automatically draw our hand back. such actions that we perform without thinking are examples of relex actions.

          This material is called ***humus***)
        - water and air
        - small worms and insects
        - small organisms like bacteria
        

2. Why is loamy soil used for growing plants? 

Loamy soil is made of sand, silt and clay. Since it holds water and nutrients better than sandy social and drains better than calyey soil, it is often used for growing plans, gardening and agriculture. 


---

3. What are the layers of soil? Explain their properties with a diagram

There are there layers of soil

- Topsoil : It is the topmost layer of soil and has sand and clay. It is rich in humus. It has many nutrients and holds water. It also contains air. 

- Subsoil: this layer contains pieces of rock and is less humus. It has less water and air than top soil. 

- Bedrock : This layer (also called **parent rock**) is mainly made up of large pieces of rock. Bedrock supports the upper layers of the soil. 


---

4. How have humans increased soil erosion? 

Human have increase social erosion by deforestation i.e. cutting down trees, overgrazing by cattle and ploughing of farmlands. 


5. How can soil be conserved

Soil  can be conserved by the following methods

- Afforestation i.e. by planting more trees. 

- Using soil cover by growing grass or covering the land by dry grass.

- Contour ploughing: It is a method of ploughing that follows the curves of the land. This slows the water flowing down and stops the soil from being washed away. 

- Terrace farming : It is practised on the slopes of the mountain. Fields are cut into the sides of mountains to look like step. These steps slow the flow of water down the slope, preventing soil erosion. 

- Growing shelter belts: Bushy plants are grown along the edges of fields to stop the wind from blowing away the soil.

Answer 5. 

a. a person has fallen down and broken and broken an ankle

    Do not move the injured person. Place an icepack on the injured part to bring
    down   the swelling. Use a split to make sure that the broken bone does not
    shift. See a   doctor as soon as possible. 
    
b. a person has been bitten by a snake? 

    Do not allow the victim to move as this will speed up the spread of venom
    through the body. Let the patient lie down in such a way that the bitten part 
    is below below the level of the heart. Treat the bite like a sprain, avoid
    movement.Arrange for a doctor or hostipal visit as soon as possible.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answers 1-3]

        Answer 1:  
        Some gases that are present in the atmosphere can trap heat and do not 
        let heat escape from the Earth's surface and thus make the air warm. 
        The effect of making air warm is called greenhouse effect.
        
        Answer 2: the green house effect has led to a slow increase in the 
        temperature of the environment. This change of climate is called global
        warming. The effect of the global warming are the followings
               - hotter climate and change in rainfall pattern
               - rise in the level of the sea and flooding of the coastal areas
               - Melting glaciers 
               
        Answer 3:
        Air pollution causes polluted gases, which combine with water vapor in
        clouds,leading to acid rain. When acid rain enters rivers and lakes, 
        it causes water pollution.

.panel[.panel-name[Answers 4-5]

      Answer 4: Pesticides can harm plans and animals. Plants take in chemicals
      from pesticides along with water. Small insects and fish eat the plants. 
      So the chemical can harm many plants and animals. 
      
      Answer 5: Natural resources are materials that are present in the 
      in the environment that we use for our daily needs. They include air, 
      soil, rocks, water, fuels, plants and animals. 
      
         - We should use the energy that we get from th sun and wind to  produce
         electricity which cause less air pollution. 
         - Do not use object and things made of plastics,  as they do not decay 
         easily and pollute water and soil.
         - Reuse objects like glass bottle, metal cans and plastic bags. 
         - Do not use large amounts of chemical fertilizers nd pesticides, instead
         we should use compost as fertilizers.

.panel[.panel-name[Answers 1-3]
  
     1.  The 'zone of life' is called the biosphere. Biosphere covers all parts
          of the Earth where there are living things. 
     
     2.  Three examples of biotic components: 
          plants, animals or any other living beings.
     
     
         Three examples of abiotic components: 
         
         soil, water, air, sunlight, mineral etc. 
    
    
    3.  Air:
        living thigs depend on air to breathe. Almost all living things use 
        oxygen from air to digest food and get energy from it. Plants make food
        using carbon dioxide. 
        
        Water:
        The cells in the body of any living thing is mostly made of water. 
        Living things also need water to transport nutrients and wastes through
        the body. Plants take up the nutrients from the soil with the help of
        water. They also use water to make their food.

        Soil:
        many small organisms, like earthworms, insects and bacteria, live in the
        soil. Even larger animals like rats, dig holes in soild to build their
        home. Plants get nutrients from the soil. 

     4. Producers produce their own food. Every food chian starts with a 
        producer, example:Plants.
        Consumers do not make their own food but eat eat other living things,
        example:animals.
       
     5. Decomposers break-down dead animal and plants material  which becomes
